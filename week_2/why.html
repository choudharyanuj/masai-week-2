				<p>In a Windows environment, users are often given a high level of access automatically. This lets them click on links and download files indiscriminately, easily leading to the issues mentioned above. Many users don’t have access to the root directories on their computers, which means that even if they do manage to infect their systems, they’ll be limited in the damage they can do.<br><br>

				Of course, good security practices mean that users shouldn’t be clicking those links in the first place. Regardless of what device you use, it ultimately comes down to whether your users employ good security awareness practices — and it’s up to you to train them.</p>

					<p>Nothing out there is free from hacking, Linux is just lot more secured compared to something like Windows for 2 reasons<br><br>
    				1.Its open source so has millions of eyeballs on code, and they scrutinize discrepancy. These people are often leading brains in computer world so they are in same league as the so called hackers.<br><br>
    				2.User base is actually quite small, and often user is more aware of things than lets say average Windows user. So that reduces probability of success</p>
